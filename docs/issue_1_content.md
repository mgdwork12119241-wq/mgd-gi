# Why mgd-gi starts from space, not answers

Most current AI systems start from symbols:
words, tokens, probabilities, answers.

But human cognition starts elsewhere.

We experience the world as space before language:
distance, proximity, movement, boundaries.

mgd-gi explores a different foundation:
what if an AI first learned to exist in space,
to grow dimensions,
to persist as a structure,
before learning to answer questions?

This issue is an invitation to discuss:
Is spatial existence a missing layer in current AI systems?
