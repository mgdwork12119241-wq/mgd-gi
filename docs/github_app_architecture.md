# 🌌 Logospace GitHub App: The Hyper-Cognitive Engine

## 1. Vision
Logospace is not just a visualization tool; it is a **GitHub App** that acts as a "Cognitive Mirror" for developers. It scans repositories to find patterns, entropy, and knowledge structures that exist beyond human linear perception.

## 2. Core Features
### A. Hyper-Pattern Discovery (HPD)
- **Beyond-Human Logic**: Analyzes code not just for bugs, but for "cognitive clusters" and "structural resonance."
- **Entropy Mapping**: Visualizes the chaos and order within a codebase to predict where the next breakthrough or failure will occur.

### B. Spatial Repository Mapping
- **3D Logic Space**: Converts the file tree and dependency graph into a navigable spatial environment.
- **Semantic Proximity**: Files that are logically related (even if in different folders) are placed close to each other in the spatial canvas.

### C. The "Oracle" Interface
- Developers can ask the AI: *"Discover patterns in this project that are beyond my current understanding."*
- The AI responds by generating a spatial "Knowledge Map" that highlights non-obvious connections.

## 3. Technical Architecture
- **Integration**: GitHub Webhooks & REST API.
- **Analysis Engine**: LLM-powered semantic analysis + Graph Theory for spatial layout.
- **Frontend**: The existing Logospace Spatial Engine (Vanilla JS + Canvas).
- **Backend**: Node.js/TypeScript (tRPC) to handle GitHub events and AI processing.

## 4. User Flow
1. Developer installs **Logospace App** on their repo.
2. The App triggers a "Cognitive Scan."
3. A `logospace.json` or a dedicated dashboard link is generated.
4. The developer enters the "Spatial Canvas" to explore their project's "Spirit."
