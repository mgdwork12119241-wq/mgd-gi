# mgd-gi | Spatial Knowledge Engine v2.0

> "Knowledge is not a list, it's a space. Thought is not a sequence, it's navigation."

**mgd-gi** is an experimental research project exploring the boundaries of spatial intelligence and knowledge representation. It transforms the traditional web interface into a boundless, zoomable canvas where information exists as spatial entities.

## 🌌 Vision
This project is built on the philosophy that human cognition is inherently spatial. By mapping concepts, media, and web content into a 2D/3D space, we enable a more intuitive way to explore complex relationships and research topics.

## 🚀 Features
- **Infinite Spatial Canvas**: Smooth pan and zoom navigation (Google Earth style).
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation between the engine, entities, and knowledge layers.
- **Multi-Entity Support**:
  - **Concept Nodes**: Abstract ideas and labels.
  - **Web Screens**: Embedded live websites via iframes.
  - **Video Screens**: Integrated YouTube/Vimeo players.
  - **Image Nodes**: Visual assets.
- **Intelligent Embedding**: Automatic URL parsing and content detection.
- **Vanilla Tech Stack**: Built with pure HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for maximum performance and zero dependencies.

## 🛠 Architecture
- `/engine`: Core systems (Camera, RenderEngine, InputHandler).
- `/entities`: Spatial object definitions and behaviors.
- `/knowledge`: Data structures for storing and linking information.
- `/utils`: Helper functions and math utilities.

## 📖 Research Philosophy
This project explores:
1. **Knowledge as Space**: How distance and proximity affect our understanding of information.
2. **Thought as Navigation**: Moving through ideas instead of clicking through pages.
3. **Links as Distances**: The strength of a relationship represented by spatial coordinates.

## 🛠 Development
To run the project locally:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
3. Use a local server (like `npx serve`) for full iframe support.
