# 🌌 Logospace: The Post-Language Cognitive Architecture

**Logospace** is the world's first **Generative Spatial Simulator** designed to explore the boundaries of human cognition and knowledge representation beyond linear language. It transforms the traditional web interface into a boundless, zoomable canvas where human intent and information exist as interactive, navigable spatial entities.

## 🚀 The Revolution: Why Logospace?

We are moving past the era of flat, linear information. Logospace introduces a **Post-Language Cognitive Architecture** where the relationship between ideas is defined by **spatial proximity and distance**, not by hyperlinks or hierarchical lists.

*   **Materialize Intent:** Use AI to instantly generate complex ideas and concepts into a 3D-like spatial environment.
*   **Navigate Thought:** Move through your knowledge space with smooth pan, zoom, and rotation, making thinking a form of exploration.
*   **Arabic First:** Full, native Right-to-Left (RTL) support, making it the premier tool for Arabic cognitive exploration.

## 📱 Available Platforms

### 🌐 Web Version (Vanilla JS)
*   **Tech**: HTML5, Canvas API, JavaScript (Pure Vanilla Stack for maximum performance).
*   **Features**: Core spatial engine, interactive toolbar, dynamic entity resizing.
*   **Try it**: [Live Demo (Coming Soon via GitHub Pages)](https://mgdwork12119241-wq.github.io/Logospace/)

### 📱 Mobile Version (React Native)
*   **Tech**: React Native, Expo, TypeScript, tRPC.
*   **Features**: Seamless mobile gestures, integrated media players (YouTube/Vimeo), full RTL support.
*   **Docs**: [Read mobile/MOBILE_README.md](./mobile/MOBILE_README.md)

## 🛠 Architecture Highlights

Logospace is built on a modular, high-performance architecture:

*   `/engine`: The core spatial mathematics, camera, and rendering loop.
*   `/entities`: Extensible system for defining new spatial objects (Concepts, Web Screens, Videos).
*   `/mobile`: The full React Native application, leveraging the same core concepts.
