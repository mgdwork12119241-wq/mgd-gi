# Generative Spatial Intelligence (mgd-gi)

## Abstract
This project explores a novel paradigm for human–AI interaction, where **human intent is translated into evolving spatial structures** rather than textual answers.  
Instead of treating AI as a question–answer system, this work investigates how intent can drive **dimensional growth** (0D → 1D → 2D → 3D) inside a generative spatial simulation.

The goal is to study whether spatial generation can serve as a more natural interface for reasoning, creativity, and cognition.

## Research Question
Can an AI system translate abstract human intent into structured, evolving spatial entities instead of static textual outputs?

---

## Hypothesis
If user intent is mapped to dimensional transformation rules, then an AI-driven system can generate spatial representations that better reflect human conceptual thinking than traditional text-based interaction.

---

## Conceptual Motivation
Most current AI systems operate through linear text exchange.  
Human cognition, however, often works spatially:
- ideas form structures
- concepts occupy relative positions
- understanding emerges through navigation, not answers

This project treats **space as the primary output**, and **intent as the input signal**.

---

## System Overview
The core abstraction is a `SpatialEntity` that evolves through dimensions:

- **0D** — point / intention seed  
- **1D** — direction / relation  
- **2D** — surface / interaction  
- **3D** — volume / environment  

Each dimensional transition represents an increase in semantic and structural complexity.

---

## Current Implementation
The project features a **Functional Research Prototype** that visualizes dimensional evolution:

- **Interactive Dashboard** (`index.html`)
  - Real-time visualization of spatial growth.
  - Interactive controls for dimensional transitions.
  - Research observation logging.
- **Core Logic** (`SpatialEntity.js`)
  - Encodes dimensional state.
  - Handles transitions between dimensions.
  - Provides the underlying mathematical model for evolution.

Dimensional evolution is currently rule-based and deterministic, serving as a controlled environment for experimentation. You can run the simulation by opening `index.html` in any modern browser.

---

## Observations
- Dimensional transitions remain stable when constrained by explicit rules.
- Even simple evolution logic produces emergent spatial structures.
- Mapping abstract intent to spatial rules is non-trivial and highlights the need for better intent representations.

---

## Limitations
- No learning mechanism yet (pure simulation).
- No natural language → intent mapping.
- No evaluation metric for “meaningfulness” of generated space.

These limitations are intentional to isolate conceptual behavior before introducing learning dynamics.

---

## Next Research Steps
Planned extensions include:
- Mapping natural language instructions to spatial transformations
- Introducing probabilistic or learned transition rules
- Studying how humans interpret generated spatial structures
- Exploring whether spatial outputs improve reasoning or creativity tasks

---

## Why This Matters
This project is about **rethinking the interface between intelligence and humans**, not about graphics or visualization.  
If AI systems are to collaborate meaningfully with human cognition, they may need to generate **structures**, not just sentences.
